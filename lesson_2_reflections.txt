What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It turns a directory into a git repository and enables version control for files in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a logical area. It's not an actual directory or a repository. It's off to the side reminding me of what files I'm going to be commiting. It definately helps with tracking current tasks. The status command is huge.
